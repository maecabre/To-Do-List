# To-Do-List
https://mysterious-river-71177.herokuapp.com/


<p>
Created a basic To-Do List app that allows users (or me) to create and remove tasks using node.js and mongoose.<br>
It stores all data in a mongodb noSQL database hosted on the cloud Mongodb Atlas<br>
Can also create a new To-Do List by adding "/my_custom_list_name" into the url path. All data will be stored and saved.<br>
App up and running through heroku.
